        <h1>The importance of a healthy lifestyle</h1>
        <p>A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. When we look after our physical health, we feel better too – fitter, more relaxed and better able to cope with things. This is especially important when you have a mental illness.<br>
        There are lots of ways of being healthy that feel good as well as doing you good.</p>

                <h2>Getting healthy</h2>
                <p>‘Healthy living’ means maintaining a healthy lifestyle and introducing habits that improve your health. It can be difficult to change old habits, 
                but there are steps you can take to become healthier.<br>
                An important first step is identifying less healthy habits and learning new, positive ones to replace them, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>what you eat and drink</li>
                    <li>sleeping well and managing stress</li>
                    <li>practicing safe sex, drinking alcohol responsibly and not abusing drugs</li>
                    <li>being physically active</li>
                    <li>being aware of any health risks related to your illness and its treatment, and working<br>
                    with your doctor to monitor these and then take action
                    </li>
                    <li>taking responsibility for your overall health including having regular check-ups for <br>
                    your eyes and teeth.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="left">How to develop positive health habits</h2>
                <p>The key to developing positive habits that you are more likely to keep is to:</p>

                <ul>

                <h2 class="left">Start slowly</h2>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Change just one thing at a time</h3>
                        <p>see the benefits that can come from eating more wholesome<br>
                         food or, taking up exercise or, quitting smoking</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Make small changes</h3>
                        <p> like going for a regular walk, instead of pushing yourself to run 5km<br>
                        every day, this will have more chance of becoming a habit you’ll keep.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Be flexible</h3>
                        <p>for example, if you decide to cut down on sugar, do it gradually over a few weeks rather than all at once.<br>
                        By cutting down from two teaspoons in your coffee to one-and-a-half,<br>
                        then one and so on, your taste buds will adapt and you’re less likely to crave for the sugar.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Build on what you already do</h3>
                        <p>for example, if you sometimes buy fruit to eat, then try buying more of this (and fewer biscuits and chips).
                            <br>
                            Remember, increasing or adding even one new health behaviour can make a big difference to your health.</p>
